# 📊 IPL Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It includes data cleaning, aggregation, statistical operations, and a variety of visualizations to extract insights from IPL deliveries data.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **File**: `deliveries.csv`
- Contains ball-by-ball data from IPL matches including batting and bowling details, runs scored, dismissals, etc.

---

## 🧪 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### ➤ NumPy Operations
- Calculated mean, standard deviation, and max of `total_runs`
- Counted total number of dot balls
- Used set operations to find unique over numbers
- Sliced arrays to display selected runs
- Computed overall run rate across all matches

### ➤ Pandas Operations
- Aggregated total runs by each team
- Identified top 5 run-scorers and top bowlers by deliveries and wickets
- Analyzed dismissal types and extra runs breakdown
- Computed average runs per over
- Counted super over deliveries, unique matches, and team appearances

---

## 📊 Visualizations

### 📈 Matplotlib
- Line plot: Total runs per over (sample match)
- Bar chart: Top 5 batsmen by total runs
- Histogram: Distribution of runs per ball
- Pie chart: Dismissal types
- Scatter plot: Over vs Total Runs

### 🌈 Seaborn
- Count plot: Deliveries by batting team
- Bar plot: Total runs per over
- Box plot: Batsman runs by over
- Heatmap: Correlation matrix of key numerical columns
- Pair plot: Relationships between run-related columns

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Identified top-performing batsmen and bowlers based on actual match data
- Analyzed trends in scoring patterns over different overs
- Visualized common dismissal methods and extra run contributions
- Calculated performance metrics like dot ball count and average run rates
